This is a project done in C that is a pipeline cache simulator, which implements and compares various implementations of a combined instruction pipeline and cache (IPLC) simulator. I wrote the Cache functions, which the goal for the cache was to find the optimal values for (1) block size, and (2) associativity such that the miss rate of the cache is minimal, yet the total size of the cache must be less than 10240 bits.
