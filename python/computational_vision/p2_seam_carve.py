'''
check_if_rotated
check's to make sure all images are horizontal
rotates the image if it is vertical instead of horizontal
'''
def check_if_rotated(img):
    row, col, color = img.shape
    rotated = False
    if row > col:
        img = np.rot90(img)
        rotated = True
    return img, rotated

'''
calcEnergy
Computes the sum of the absolute values of the x and y derivatives of the image produced by
the OpenCV function Sobel
'''
def calcEnergy(img):
    gray_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(np.float32(gray_img), cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
    sobely = cv2.Sobel(np.float32(gray_img), cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
    energy = np.add(np.abs(sobelx), np.abs(sobely))
    return energy

'''
calcWeight
using the energy matrix created by calcEnergy with the Sobel function,
we assign weights to each index of the image based on this "energy".
We assign columns 0 and N âˆ’ 1 to be infinity since we do not want to delete the edges.
We go through the matrix like so:
-go through starting with the first row (this is just a row of energies)
-set the 0th and last indicies to be infinity
-get all indicies between the first and last (exclusive)
-go to the row below, for each index you add the min energy from the 
 row above (just contained to the touching indecies) (we use a stacking method for comparison)
 say this is the original energy matrix:
 ____________________________________
 |__5_|__8_|_12_|__2_|_22_|__8_|__9_|
 |__3_|_12_|__7_|_21_|_14_|__4_|_10_|
 |_11_|__3_|__9_|_13_|__6_|_32_|_23_|
 
 using this example, we then add the min touching index to the index below it, like so:
 ____________________________________
 |__5_|__8_|_12_|__2_|_22_|__8_|__9_|
 |__8_|_17_|__9_|_23_|_16_|_12_|_18_|
 the 8 above comes from the index being 3 originally, then taking the min of the indicies touching
 above (5 and 8, so 5 is the min) and adding that min to the index (3+5=8)
 the 17 above comes from the index being 12 originally, then taking the min of the touching indicies (5, 8, 12)
 in the row above and adding the min of those 3 indicies to the index (12+5 = 17)
 etc following this pattern, the following row using these newly added numbers would be:
 |_19_|_11_|_18_|_22_|_18_|_44_|_35_|
 the 19 comes from orginal index 11 adding the min of the touching above indices (8, 17) (11+8=19), etc

'''
findSeam
just finds the seam that will be deleted
-starts at the bottom row of the image
-finds the index of the minimum value
-goes up the rows towards the top of the image,
    checking the indicies of the minimum index and its neighbors
    to find the path up the image of the seam

'''
deleteSeam
deleting the indicies of the seam from the image
using a mask which creates the image in bools and sets
the seam index to be deleted to be false so when the image
is merged back together only the true indicies will remain, 
properly cutting out the seam
