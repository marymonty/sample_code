if the image is longer than it is fatter then it needs to be
rotated 90 degrees before it is sliced (making all images horizontal)

'''
assign columns 0 and N âˆ’ 1 absurdly large weights

-go through starting with the first row (this is just a row of energies)
-go to the row below, for each index you add the min energy from the 
 row above (just contained to the touching indecies)
 say this is the original energy matrix:
 _______________________________
 |_5_|_8_|_12_|_2_|_22_|_8_|_9_|
 |_3_| 12_|_7_|_21_|_14_|_4_|_10_|
 |_11_|_3_|_9_|_13_|_6_|_32_|_23_|
 
 the way I am understanding this is that we go through like this,
 adding the min from above to the numbers below
 _______________________________
 |_5_|_8_|_12_|_2_|_22_|_8_|_9_|
 |_8_| 17_|_9_|_23_|_16_|_12_|_18_|
 |_19_|_11_|_18_|_22_|_18_|_44_|_35_|
 

going through row by row of the energy matrix
setting the 0th and last indicies to be infinity
getting all indicies between the first and last (exclusive)
but getting those middle indicies staggard (left, right, center)
these staggard arrays can then be stacked so that each column
of the stacked array will be the comparison between one index and
its two neighbors. finding the minimum of this column will give 
the minimum value of the index and its neighbors. this min value
gets added to the index in the row below it. we go row by row doing this
