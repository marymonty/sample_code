For my Animation MFA thesis project, I am creating a video game about my experience as a queer woman growing up in the Philadelphia DIY music scene. 
I am spending 2023 teaching myself Unity and C# to bring this video game to life. These C# files are from that video game. 
I try to keep my C# files short and consice, limited to performing a single task. 

The DetectCollisionWithCam script is applied to the characters in the scene and detects when the character has collided with the player (main camera). Once this collision is detected, the character is forced to turn and face the camera.
