Comfortable utilizing C# for tool or script creation in Unity. 

PrefabReplaceEditor is an editor script that creates an editor window. This window allows the user to add GameObjects in the scene to a list to be replaced by a user specified Prefab. With this replacement, I also update script components and referenced objects and scripts within the script component. 

The DetectCollisionWithCam script is from my thesis video game, and is applied to the characters in the scene and detects when the character has collided with the player (main camera). Once this collision is detected, the character is forced to turn and face the camera.
